## Business task statement
This analysis is part of capstone project taught by Google and is part of Data Analytics Professional
Certification.

The following is description of a business problem encountered by a bike-sharing company called "Cyclistic".

![Cyclistic logo]("C:/Users/Solomon/Documents/RFiles/divvy-quarterly-data/csv/cycl-logo.png")

Cyclistic representatives claim that annual members are much more profitable than casual ones, therefore the task is to figure out ways to convert the latter into the former ones. Based on that analysis marketing strategies can be designed accordingly. In order to achieve this goal, differences between two groups have to be identified, i.e. why would a casual rider acquire an annual membership and how digital media could play a role in their marketing tactics. 

This particular report is focused on delivering insights on differences between two categories of riders who use services offered by Cyclistic. Analysis made from trip data is used to draw useful conclusions and figure out ways to appeal to annual riders.


## Analysis
#### Install required packages
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse) # for data wrangling
library(lubridate) # for wrangling data attributes
library(ggplot2) # for visualizations
```

#### Set current working directory

```{r include=FALSE}
getwd() # displays your working directory
```

### STEP 1: Collect Data
#### Upload divvy datasets

```{r include=FALSE}
q2_2019 <- read_csv("Divvy_Trips_2019_Q2.csv")
q3_2019 <- read_csv("Divvy_Trips_2019_Q3.csv")
q4_2019 <- read_csv("Divvy_Trips_2019_Q4.csv")
q1_2020 <- read_csv("Divvy_Trips_2020_Q1.csv")
```
### STEP 2: Wrangle Data and Combine Into a Single File

#### Check column names before binding datasets into one

```{r}
colnames(q3_2019)
colnames(q4_2019)
colnames(q2_2019)
colnames(q1_2020)
```

#### Renaming columns names so that they are consistent with q1_2020 dataset

```{r include=FALSE}
(q4_2019 <- rename(q4_2019
                   ,ride_id = trip_id
                   ,rideable_type = bikeid 
                   ,started_at = start_time  
                   ,ended_at = end_time  
                   ,start_station_name = from_station_name 
                   ,start_station_id = from_station_id 
                   ,end_station_name = to_station_name 
                   ,end_station_id = to_station_id 
                   ,member_casual = usertype))

(q3_2019 <- rename(q3_2019
                   ,ride_id = trip_id
                   ,rideable_type = bikeid 
                   ,started_at = start_time  
                   ,ended_at = end_time  
                   ,start_station_name = from_station_name 
                   ,start_station_id = from_station_id 
                   ,end_station_name = to_station_name 
                   ,end_station_id = to_station_id 
                   ,member_casual = usertype))

(q2_2019 <- rename(q2_2019
                   ,ride_id = "01 - Rental Details Rental ID"
                   ,rideable_type = "01 - Rental Details Bike ID" 
                   ,started_at = "01 - Rental Details Local Start Time"  
                   ,ended_at = "01 - Rental Details Local End Time"  
                   ,start_station_name = "03 - Rental Start Station Name" 
                   ,start_station_id = "03 - Rental Start Station ID"
                   ,end_station_name = "02 - Rental End Station Name" 
                   ,end_station_id = "02 - Rental End Station ID"
                   ,member_casual = "User Type"))
```
#### Inspects dataframes for incongruencies

```{r}
str(q1_2020)
str(q4_2019)
str(q3_2019)
str(q2_2019)
```
#### Convert ride_id and rideable_type to character so that they can stack correctly

```{r include=FALSE}
q4_2019 <-  mutate(q4_2019, ride_id = as.character(ride_id)
                   ,rideable_type = as.character(rideable_type)) 
q3_2019 <-  mutate(q3_2019, ride_id = as.character(ride_id)
                   ,rideable_type = as.character(rideable_type)) 
q2_2019 <-  mutate(q2_2019, ride_id = as.character(ride_id)
                   ,rideable_type = as.character(rideable_type)) 
```

#### Stack individual quarter's data frames into one big data frame
```{r include=FALSE}
all_trips <- bind_rows(q2_2019, q3_2019, q4_2019, q1_2020)
```


#### Remove lat, long, birthyear, and gender fields as this data was dropped beginning in 2020

```{r include=FALSE}
all_trips <- all_trips %>%  
  select(-c(start_lat, start_lng, end_lat, end_lng, birthyear, gender, "01 - Rental Details Duration In Seconds Uncapped", "05 - Member Details Member Birthday Year", "Member Gender", "tripduration"))
```

### STEP 3. Clean Up And Add Data To Prepare For Analysis

#### Inspect the new table that has been created

```{r}
colnames(all_trips)  #List of column names
nrow(all_trips)  #How many rows are in data frame?
dim(all_trips)  #Dimensions of the data frame?
head(all_trips)  #See the first 6 rows of data frame.  Also tail(qs_raw)
str(all_trips)  #See list of columns and data types (numeric, character, etc)
summary(all_trips)  #Statistical summary of data. Mainly for numerics
```

#### There are a few problems we will need to fix:
#### (1) In the "member_casual" column, there are two names for members ("member" and "Subscriber") and two names for casual riders ("Customer" and "casual"). We will need to consolidate that from four to two labels.
#### (2) The data can only be aggregated at the ride-level, which is too granular. We will want to add some additional columns of data -- such as day, month, year -- that provide additional opportunities to aggregate the data.
#### (3) We will want to add a calculated field for length of ride since the 2020Q1 data did not have the "tripduration" column. We will add "ride_length" to the entire dataframe for consistency.
#### (4) There are some rides where tripduration shows up as negative, including several hundred rides where Divvy took bikes out of circulation for Quality Control reasons. We will want to delete these rides.

#### In the "member_casual" column, replace "Subscriber" with "member" and "Customer" with "casual"
#### - Before 2020, Divvy used different labels for these two types of riders ... we will want to make our dataframe consistent with their current nomenclature
#### - N.B.: "Level" is a special property of a column that is retained even if a subset does not contain any values from a specific level

#### Begin by seeing how many observations fall under each usertype
```{r}
table(all_trips$member_casual)
```
#### Reassign to the desired values (we will go with the current 2020 labels)
```{r include=FALSE}
all_trips <-  all_trips %>% 
  mutate(member_casual = recode(member_casual
                           ,"Subscriber" = "member"
                           ,"Customer" = "casual"))
```

#### Check to make sure the proper number of observations were reassigned
```{r}
table(all_trips$member_casual)
```
#### Add columns that list the date, month, day, and year of each ride
#### This will allow us to aggregate ride data for each month, day, or year ... before completing these operations we could only aggregate at the ride level
#### https://www.statmethods.net/input/dates.html more on date formats in R found at that link
```{r include=FALSE}
all_trips$date <- as.Date(all_trips$started_at) #The default format is yyyy-mm-dd
all_trips$month <- format(as.Date(all_trips$date), "%m")
all_trips$day <- format(as.Date(all_trips$date), "%d")
all_trips$year <- format(as.Date(all_trips$date), "%Y")
all_trips$day_of_week <- format(as.Date(all_trips$date), "%A")
```

#### Add a "ride_length" calculation to all_trips (in seconds)
```{r include=FALSE}
all_trips$ride_length <- difftime(all_trips$ended_at,all_trips$started_at) # trip duration as difference between end and start
```

#### Inspect the structure of the columns
```{r}
str(all_trips)
```

#### Convert "ride_length" from factor to numeric so we can run calculations on the data
```{r}
is.factor(all_trips$ride_length)
all_trips$ride_length <- as.numeric(as.character(all_trips$ride_length))
is.numeric(all_trips$ride_length)
```

#### Remove "bad" data
#### The dataframe includes a few hundred entries when bikes were taken out of docks and checked for quality by Divvy or ride_length was negative
#### We will create a new version of the dataframe (v2) since data is being removed
#### https://www.datasciencemadesimple.com/delete-or-drop-rows-in-r-with-conditions-2/
```{r include=FALSE}
all_trips_v2 <- all_trips[!(all_trips$start_station_name == "HQ QR" | all_trips$ride_length<0),]
```

### STEP 4. Descriptive Analysis

#### Descriptive analysis on ride_length (all figures in seconds)
```{r}
mean(all_trips_v2$ride_length) #straight average (total ride length / rides)
median(all_trips_v2$ride_length) #midpoint number in the ascending array of ride lengths
max(all_trips_v2$ride_length) #longest ride
min(all_trips_v2$ride_length) #shortest ride
```

#### Four lines above condensed to one line using summary() on the specific attribute
```{r}
summary(all_trips_v2$ride_length)
```

#### Compare members and casual users
```{r}
aggregate(all_trips_v2$ride_length ~ all_trips_v2$member_casual, FUN = mean)
aggregate(all_trips_v2$ride_length ~ all_trips_v2$member_casual, FUN = median)
aggregate(all_trips_v2$ride_length ~ all_trips_v2$member_casual, FUN = max)
aggregate(all_trips_v2$ride_length ~ all_trips_v2$member_casual, FUN = min)
```

#### See the average ride time by each day for members vs casual users
```{r include=FALSE}
counts <- aggregate(all_trips_v2$ride_length ~ all_trips_v2$member_casual + all_trips_v2$day_of_week, FUN = mean)
```

#### Notice that the days of the week are out of order. Let's fix that.
```{r include=FALSE}
all_trips_v2$day_of_week <- ordered(all_trips_v2$day_of_week, levels=c("Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday"))
```


#### Analyze ridership data by type and weekday
```{r include=FALSE}
all_trips_v2 %>% 
  mutate(weekday = wday(started_at, label = TRUE)) %>%  #creates weekday field using wday()
  group_by(member_casual, weekday) %>%  #groups by usertype and weekday
  summarise(number_of_rides = n()							#calculates the number of rides and average duration 
  ,average_duration = mean(ride_length)) %>% 		# calculates the average duration
  arrange(member_casual, weekday)								# sorts
```

#### Let's visualize the number of rides by rider type
```{r}
all_trips_v2 %>% 
  mutate(weekday = wday(started_at, label = TRUE)) %>% 
  group_by(member_casual, weekday) %>% 
  summarise(number_of_rides = n()
            ,average_duration = mean(ride_length)) %>% 
  arrange(member_casual, weekday)  %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = weekday, y = number_of_rides, fill = member_casual)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge")
```

#### Let's create a visualization for average duration
```{r}
all_trips_v2 %>% 
  mutate(weekday = wday(started_at, label = TRUE)) %>% 
  group_by(member_casual, weekday) %>% 
  summarise(number_of_rides = n()
            ,average_duration = mean(ride_length)) %>% 
  arrange(member_casual, weekday)  %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = weekday, y = average_duration, fill = member_casual)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge")
```

### STEP 5. Export Summary File For Further Analysis

#### Save the average ride length variable in a .csv file

```{r include=FALSE}
write.csv(counts, file = 'C:/Users/Solomon/Documents/RFiles/divvy-quarterly-data/csv/avg_ride_length.csv')
```
